              <p class="user-message-2">"I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've been looking 
                to make a transition and have heard some people who had an amaizing experience here, I signed up for the free intro 
                course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time
                of my life. Since completing the course, I've successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at VR startup."

                <p class="user-message-4">"Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code. 
                    I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. 
                    I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about 
                    the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never 
                    had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning
                    to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I've often referred to it during interviews
                    as an example of my development experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving 
                    multiple offoers. 100% recommended!"

              </p>
                <p class="user-message-2">"The staff seem genuinely concerned about mt progress which I find really refreshing. The program gave me the 
                    confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable junior developer. The standard is above the rest 
                    . You will get the personal attention you need from an incredible community of smart and amaizing people."
